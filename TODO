List of things todo

- Add url dowload history and incorporate into the UI
- Add prompt to display the packages and things that are going to be done and ask the user if they want to continue.
- Add current packages versus the ones they need. Proceed if everything is OK and prompt to install new software if not.
- Add directory chooser for dir entry widget and possibly for the playlist too
- Add the ability to feed the program a file that only includes names of songs and the respective artist for each song. 
  We'll call it a fetching function to make it easier on the user. We can do this instead of feeding the program a file with a bunch of hand picked URLs.
